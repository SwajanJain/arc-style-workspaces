## 🎯 The Problem

**Horizontal tabs are outdated for serious work:**

❌ **Tab overload** – 20+ tabs make it impossible to see what's open.
❌ **No organization** – Can't group tabs by project or context.
❌ **Wasted space** – Horizontal tabs eat precious screen real estate.
❌ **Duplication** – Clicking Gmail opens *another* Gmail tab instead of focusing the existing one.
❌ **Context switching chaos** – Jumping between work, personal, and side projects is messy.

**Result?** You waste time hunting for tabs, or end up with 50+ cluttered windows.

### 💡 Why This Matters Now

* **Arc Browser users love its vertical tabs and workspaces.** However, The Browser Company has discontinued regular updates for Arc, so we're unlikely to ever see true agentic experiences like Comet or Atlas inside Arc itself. Many power users worry that Arc isn't evolving in line with where the web is headed, and even their other AI browser Dia lacks vertical tab management.
* **AI-first browsers (Comet, Atlas, and Dia)** are building agentic, AI-native experiences. But they all force horizontal tabs, with no Arc-style vertical management.
* **Chrome/Brave/Edge users** never had Arc's vertical system to begin with.

**This extension solves that.** → Get Arc's vertical tab organization and smart switching in *any* Chromium browser, while enjoying the AI/agentic future that Arc never built.

## ✨ The Solution

**Arc-Style Workspaces** brings vertical tab management to Chrome/Edge/Brave/Comet with:

### 🎯 Smart Tab Switching (Arc's Killer Feature)

* Click Gmail favorite → **Focuses your existing Gmail tab** (or creates new if not open).
* Navigate around in Gmail → Clicking Gmail again brings you *back to that bound tab*.
* No more 5 Slack tabs or duplicate dashboards.

**Power options:**

* Shift+Click = Force new tab.
* Cmd+Click = Open in background.
* Alt+Click = Cycle through multiple matches.

### 📁 Workspaces by Context

* Separate **Work, Design, Client, Personal** flows.
* Collapse/expand workspaces for focus.
* Drag, rename, and alias tabs.

### ⭐ Favorites Grid

* Favicon-only favorites in a clean **4-column grid**, dynamically adjusting rows.
* One-click access to daily tools.
* Minimal, visual, clutter-free.

### 🔍 Quick Search

* `Cmd/Ctrl+K` to filter across favorites, workspaces, and open tabs.
* Lightning fast context switching.

## 👥 Who This Is For

* **Arc fans** who love vertical tabs but want AI-native browsers.
* **Product managers & knowledge workers** juggling Slack, dashboards, docs, and calendars.
* **Developers/designers** who need organized contexts across multiple projects.
* **Chrome/Brave/Edge users** tired of tab overload.

Not for: casual browsers with <5 tabs, or those who prefer horizontal layouts.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Smart Tab Switching** – focus existing tabs instead of duplicating.
2. **Collapsible Workspaces** – organize tabs by project, client, or context.
3. **Favorites Grid** – Arc-style favicon-only grid with dynamic rows.

6. **Keyboard-first UX** – shortcuts for panel toggle, search, and tab actions.

## 🆚 Why Not Just Use Arc?

* Arc = ✅ design + vertical tabs, ❌ AI roadmap, ❌ Windows support slowing.
* Comet/Atlas = ✅ AI/agentic browsing, ❌ horizontal tabs, ❌ poor workspace management.
* Chrome/Brave = ✅ stable, extensible, ❌ no vertical tabs.

**This extension = The bridge.**
Arc's vertical tab power + modern AI browsers + your preferred environment.
